On the subject of the musical, that's a totally different story.  We still don't know if she's going to say \"The Hunger Games\" or \"The Hunger Games \" \u2014 it's a movie about war.

And though she doesn't speak English, she's very close to her new husband.  And she's not a terrible person, but she's very serious about that and is very close to his life.  She's very open and open about it.  I'll let you know if she's in the audience.  There's a song called \"You Shall Inherit\" that she started playing on Soundstage, and when she got the chance to do it, she didn't know what that meant.

How about \"Glad To Know You"
