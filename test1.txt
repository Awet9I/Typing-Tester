{"44": "Summer day is the day in the fall when an abundance of birds arrives, a feast is celebrated and the fruit of the harvest is passed from hand to hand, and we do not see the sun in its highest glory but the birds flying about the ground In summer it is a new year in the fields, and the crops grow in abundance And I am glad that this is what the summer is like for you all, for you find yourselves in a beautiful, green heaven, and the sun is shining down on your face and on your feet The harvest, moreover, is in your hands, when you buy the fruit of the field and when you grow your own fruit The harvest is in our possession as you will buy in the fall, as the harvest is in a spring And in the autumn, where there is winter, and where the sun passes and passes through winter, there comes the sun shining down on your face and on your feet, and all that is in your possession come and greet you Now, those who are in the summer have their seasons in their hands, and those in the spring have their seasons in their hands If we were a nation and you were a nation you would not have these kinds of things; for they are full of life, full of beauty, of fruit, full of happiness, of music, full of good and bad, full of power and wickedness But they are filled with the kind of joy, full of a life"}

I had never met her, but at first, it was because I had met one girl on the street before And now, I was just meeting something new!
